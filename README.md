# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe game designed with CLI &amp; Haskell

### Haskell for Beginners tips i learned

- to run ghci compiler you can do ghci and that compiles all changes then do :l {filename}. this gets you back to main.

- :r for reload

- :t gets the type declaration for what ever you typed in
- to run entire file compiler with main = do, run ghc -- make {filename}

- :q to quit compiler
